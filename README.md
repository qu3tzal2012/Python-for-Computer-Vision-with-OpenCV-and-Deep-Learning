### Python-for-Computer-Vision-with-OpenCV-and-Deep-Learning

In this repository, we will work on Computer Vision related topics with OpenCV and Deep learning. Applications include ***Image Processing, Object Tracking, Convolutional Neural Networks, Yolo v3 with Python***

<b> Goals of this course: </b>
- [ ] Understand Computer Vision Applications
- [ ] Understand how to use OpenCV and Python work with iamges and videos
- [ ] Apply these skills to projects
 
<b> Course Outline </b>
- [ ] NumPy and Image Basics (<i> Indexing & Slicing, read and display images, basic compands and drawings </i>)
- [ ] Image Processing with OpenCV (<i> Advanced OpenCV operations </i>)
- [ ] Video Processing with OpenCV (<i> Basic working of video files, streaming webcam with OpenCV library</i>)
- [ ] Object Detection (<i> template matching to face detection</i>)
- [ ] Object Tracking (<i> tracking objects in videos</i>)
- [ ] Deep Learning with Computer Vision (<i> Neural networks, Image Classification </i>)

**We will be skip NumPy basics as we will focus more on image basics with Numpy arrays and move from there**
